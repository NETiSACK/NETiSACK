I'm currently developing "something" desktop/web applications based on Lua language.

- Learning `C`, `Lua`, `Lapis`, `qruiLua`, `PostgreSQL`
- OS Environments `Windows 10 IoT LTSC`, `Debian 12 (WSL2)`
- Editors of choice `Lite XL`, `Neovim`, `VSCode`

Note for "some" people known me for old projects like Anmincat Linux, I'm not returning to that project anymore due to lost interest.<br>
Also, all of my old Github accounts has been abandoned due to password database lost.

Thank you for understanding.

Peace, Oak.
